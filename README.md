# ImageColorizer
Using tensorflow, these convoluted neural networks convert single and groups of black and white images to color. Note: all of these files are configured to take input from a fixed path on a local machine. In order to train/test the network, change the path for the input file in the code

Alpha file:

This network converts a single black and white image to color.
Input: a single color image
Output: the original image, the black and white conversion of the image, the output of the network when the black and white image is taken as input


Beta file:

This network converts a group of images from black and white to color.
Input: a group of color images
Output: the input images are converted to black and white and colorized by the network as output
